                            An aspiring software engineer with a passion for technology. 
                            Acquired an associates in Web Development. Over the past few years 
                            I have gained experience at Fairleigh Dickinson University and 
                            Bergen Community College in Web Development. This really allowed me
                            to develop my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Not only
                            that, I have also obtained a few computer related jobs as a 
                            freelancer during my college career.
